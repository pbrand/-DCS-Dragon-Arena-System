\section{Experimental Results}

\subsection{Setup}
During the implementation of the game, the game was mainly tested on the local machines.
To simulate the distribution of the system locally, different RMI registries were used for the main classes which are supposed to run on different nodes.
By doing so, the running classes need to call a different (local) server in order to make an RMI call.

\subsection{Consistency Experiments}
One important issue in a distributed game is keeping the game-state consistent for every client and server.
This means that battlefield needs to be somehow updated for every client in order to be able to play the game.
As stated in the previous chapter, the whenever a client sends a request, the required information is returned to the helper server the client is connected to.
The helpers server itself does not maintain a local state of the game, but only computes results.
However, the clients and battlefield do maintain a state of the game. 
Therefore it is important for the master server to maintain a correct state of the game.
