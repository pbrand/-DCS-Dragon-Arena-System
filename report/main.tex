%a description of the problem, system description, analysis overview, and one main result. Size: one paragraph with at most 150 words.
This report discusses the the process of implementing a distributed version of the Dragon Arena System (DAS) in order to be scalable and to support multiple concurrent users playing the game.
The game architecture will consist of two main layers; the helper server layer and the main server layer.
The helper servers will perform computation and the servers in the main layer will keep track of the battlefield en eventual copies of the battlefield.
The communication between the servers and the clients and servers will be done via Java's Remote Method Invocation.

\section{Introduction}

%(recommended size, including points 1 and 2: 1 page): describe the problem, the existing systems and/or tools about which you know (related work), the system you are about to implement, and the structure of the remainder of the article. Use one short paragraph for each.
The Dragon Arena System (DAS) is an online warfare game of WantGame BV.
WantGame BV wants to implement a distributed version of the DAS in order to be able to support multiple concurrent users and make the system scalable.
The game will be implemented in Java and will use Remote Method Invocation (RMI) in order to support remote call to other servers.

This report will first discuss a bit about the application itself and its background.
Afterwards, the design and architecture of the proposed system which is going to be implemented will be discussed. 
The various high level components of the game and how they communicate will be explained.
In the third section the results of the various performed tests are presented and at last there will be a discussion about the findings of our work.
