\section{Conclusion}
The implementation of a distributed game is quite a challenge, certainly if you're a beginner in the Distributed Systems field.
It is safe to conclude that in this case the helper servers are not of much use and that the use of multiple battlefield server could have been better.
However, this does not mean that the current design is all that bad, the experiments do show that the current design does scale and is able to support multiple concurrent users.
Clients may also recover from helper server crashes by just reconnecting to a different one and the main server may be replaces by a backup server if it crashes, which makes the the system fault-tolerance to a certain level.
